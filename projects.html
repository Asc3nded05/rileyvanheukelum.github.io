                This was my first animation for the <i class="purple">Motion Media Design and Animation I</i> class that I took in the Fall of 2024. We were tasked with creating a lower thirds graphic with a build in and build out animation that could be used for an interview. Despite this being my first major animation project and the first time I was using Adobe After Effects, I decided it would be fascinating to challenge myself to create a dragon. This project definitely pushed the boundaries of my skills at the time but I really learned a lot and am very proud of the end result. The body was created with a path object and a trim paths effect to create the main motion and then the extra elements like the head, wings, arms, legs, and spikes were animated along individually to follow the motion of the body.

                For our second project in <i class="purple">Motion Media Design and Animation I</i>, we were tasked with creating a kintetic typography animation that took a clip from a song, movie, or show and created interesting motion primarily with just the text elements and very limited additional graphics. For this project I chose a section of Luthen's mologue from season 1, episode 10 of <i class="purple">Andor</i>, one of my favorite shows of all time. To push myself with this project, and to better reflect the tone and style of the scene and show, I decided to break away from the flat graphic style we were learning and instead learn how to work with textures and effects to create a more interesting and unique graphic style.

                Our final project for <i class="purple">Motion Media Design and Animation I</i> was to create a 35-45 second long animation with voiceover explaining some idea or topic that is somewhat complicated and unfamiliar to most people. As a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works I chose to base my animation on the beautiful opening poem of <i class="purple">The Silmarilion</i>, <i class="purple">The AinulindalÃ«</i>. This poem recounts the beginning of time as the world and everything in it is created in a beautiful song. To fit the style of the original text I mixed several classical pieces for the background music and attempted to created a painted asthetic for my graphics by layering effects and textures. This animation was entered and accepted into <span class="purple">Houghton University's 36th Annual Juried Student Exhibition</span> where it was awarded the <span class="purple">Ben Frank and Jean Moss Award</span>.

                This animation was created for the first project of <i class="purple">Motion Media Design and Animation II</i>, which I took in the spring of 2025. The goal of this project was to create a 6-12 second countdown animation that mimicked a collage, stop-motion asthetic. For this project I was inspired by my love of cryptids and horror and wanted to create an omnious piece that counted down to a camper in the woods being attacked by a Wendigo (A Native-American demon turned popular modern-day cryptid). I'm particularly proud of the graphic style I was able to achieve with this piece, using hand-made pen drawings that were scanned in as digital graphics which I used to build my scenes. This was combined with a variety of texture loops and effects to recreate the flickering light of a campfire in the woods at night while maintainig a tactile, stop-motion feel. Additionally, for this project I created several fake missing persons posters and newspaper clippings featuring my friends and I to create the numbers in the countdown and hint at a deeper story for careful viewers. Of all of my projects, this is the one that I feel most fully realizes my vision. This animation was entered and accepted into <span class="purple">Houghton University's 36th Annual Juried Student Exhibition</span>.

                The second project of <i class="purple">Motion Media Design and Animation II</i> was to create a 20-30 second animation telling a part of an classic fairy-tale, legend or myth while utilizing the 3D camera in After Effects. When trying to decide what story to base my animation on, I began by thinking of what new graphic style I would like to attempt for this project. Ultimately, I was inspired to try and achieve a style similar to that of the late medieval gothic illuminated manuscripts and decided to use the classic Arthurian legend of <span class="purple">The Sword in the Stone</span>. The art style was primarily informed by using The Crusader Bible as reference. In additon to learning and using the 3D camera for this project, I also began learning some simple character animation using Duik Angela to create character rigs. Though I wasn't able to fully achieve my vision within the time limits for this project, this animation truly pushed the boundaries of my skills and expanded my animation abilities.

To represent the music-based nature of the company, I mimicked an audio visualizer for the logo to bounce in on. This was my first experience with animation, though the focus was more on the 3D modeling aspects than on learning animation skills.

                The final project of <i class="purple">Introduction to 3D Computer Graphics</i> was to create a series of three images featuring at least three separate objects that were modeled from reference. For this project I was inspired by analog horror series like <span class="purple">The Mandela Catalogue</span> and <span class="purple">Gemini Home Entertainment</span> which often depict terrifying supernatural events in juxtaposition with a somewhat absurdist presentation. To this end, I styled my three images as warning posters made by a fictional government organization called the Agency of Anomalous Entities warning citizens of the dangers of encountering extra-dimensional objects, which is depicted with two-dimensional figures encountering three-dimentional objects. To play up the absurdity of the situation, I chose a random selection of objects that I thought would be interesting to model, particularly a <span class="purple">Nintendo Entertainment System</span> controler, a pot and a desk. I worked with a toon-shader and played with the coloring of my objects to help blend the 2D and 3D worlds and create a cohesive feel.

                For my <i class="purple">Discrete Mathematics</i> clas which I took in the Fall of 2024, we were assigned a project where we worked with a partner through a challenging mathematics problem and wrote a report on our solutions. My partner and I chose the problem that reads as follows: "Hamilton Avenue has 2n houses. On one side of the street are the houses numbered 1, 3, 5, 7 (etc.) and directly opposite are houses 2, 4, 6, 8 (etc.), respectively. An eccentric postman starts deliveries at house 1 and delivers letters to each of the houses, finally returning to house 1 for a cup of tea. Throughout the entire journey he must observe the following rules. The numbers of the houses delivered to must follow an odd-even-odd-even pattern throughout, each house except house 1 is visited exactly once (house 1 is visited twice) and the postman at no time is allowed to cross the road to the house directly opposite. How many different delivery sequences are possible if n = 4? 5? 6? Are there values of n for which the postman is unable to follow all the rules?" Though we began our process by manually computing the number of delivery routes and looking for patterns, we quickly realized the imposibility of that approach with higher values of n. To comfirm the answers we had already calculated and to compute the number of delivery routes for n=6 and above, I wrote a program to do the caluclations automatically.
